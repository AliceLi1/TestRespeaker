Weather Cloud is an awesome project for ReSpeaker. This cool build turns a ReSpeaker into a Weather Cloud, which is able to show you the whether with vivid light and sounds.

In this project, Openwrt is in charge of getting realtime weather information from the Internet, making voice interaction and audio output, while Arduino is responsible for controlling the colorful RGB LEDs.
